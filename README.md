# Facial Expressions Recognition

By [Rifky Aliffa](https://github.com/Penzragon)

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the fer2013 dataset. The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The faces have been automatically registered so that the face is more or less centred and occupies about the same amount of space in each image. You can download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013).

## Objective

The objective of this project is to build a convolutional neural network model that can recognize human facial expressions.
